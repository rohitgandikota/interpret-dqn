# How can Deep-Q-Networks play Ping-Pong?

In this work, we aim to interpret how DQN can play Ping Pong games using network dissect and grad cam. We find that certain neurons look at the boundaries and certain others look at the ball. We also find that the agent monitors both the opponent's and its own score before making a decision. This is a very tactical perception by the agent before making a decision. It seems like the agent weighs the risk taking capabilities based on the scores.
